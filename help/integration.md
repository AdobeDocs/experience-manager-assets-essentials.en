# Integration with other Adobe solutions {#integrations}

It lets users use the basic assets functionality from within the native application or interface, without having to leave their familiar applications.

* **[!DNL Creative Cloud for Enterprise]**: Creative professionals can connect to [!DNL Assets Essentials] repository from within the supported [!DNL Adobe Creative Cloud] desktop apps using [Adobe Asset Link extension](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/business/enterprise/adobe-asset-link.html) (in-app panel). The in-app panel is available for [!DNL Adobe Photoshop], [!DNL Adobe Illustrator], [!DNL Adobe InDesign], and [!DNL Adobe XD]. It allows for a streamlined access to assets that increases content velocity.
