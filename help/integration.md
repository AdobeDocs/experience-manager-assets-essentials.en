# Integration with other Adobe solutions

Assets Essentials integrates well with the supported Adobe solutions and provides an embedded experience from within the interfaces of these applications. It lets users use the basic assets functionality from within the native application or interface, without having to leave their familiar applications.

The embedded Assets Essentials experience is currently undergoing beta testing and evaluation in the following solutions:

* Creative Cloud for enterprise: Creative professionals can connect to Assets Essentials repository from within supported Creative Cloud desktop apps using [Adobe Asset Link extension](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/business/enterprise/adobe-asset-link.html) (in-app panel), available for Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Adobe XD. It allows for a streamlined access to assets, thereby increasing content velocity. See [manage assets using Adobe Asset Link](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/manage-assets-using-adobe-asset-link.ug.html).

* Adobe Journey Optimizer (beta): When designing messages using [Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/customer-journey-management/using/cjm-home.html), you can access Assets Essentials repository directly from within the Journey Optimizer interface. Journey Optimizerâ€™s users get access to assets, using the embeddable Asset Selector user interface of Assets Essentials. See [using Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/customer-journey-management/using/create-messages/assets-essentials.html).

Additional integrations will be rolling out, with an integration with [Adobe Workfront](https://www.workfront.com/) expected to be available next.
