# Integration with other Adobe solutions {#integrations}

[!DNL Assets Essentials] integrates well with the supported Adobe solutions and provides an embedded experience from within the interfaces of these applications. It lets users use the basic assets functionality from within the native application or interface, without having to leave their familiar applications.

The embedded [!DNL Assets Essentials] experience is undergoing beta testing and evaluation in the following solutions:

* [!DNL Creative Cloud for Enterprise]: Creative professionals can connect to [!DNL Assets Essentials] repository from within the supported [!DNL Adobe Creative Cloud] desktop apps using [Adobe Asset Link extension](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/business/enterprise/adobe-asset-link.html) (in-app panel). The in-app panel is available for [!DNL Adobe Photoshop], [!DNL Adobe Illustrator], [!DNL Adobe InDesign], and [!DNL Adobe XD]. It allows for a streamlined access to assets that increases content velocity. See [manage assets using [!DNL Adobe Asset Link]](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/manage-assets-using-adobe-asset-link.ug.html).

* [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer] (beta): When designing messages using [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you can access [!DNL Assets Essentials] repository directly from within the [!DNL Journey Optimizer] interface. Users get access to assets, using the embedded <!-- Asset Selector --> user interface of [!DNL Assets Essentials]. 

<!-- TBD: Update this link
See [using [!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/create-messages/assets-essentials.html). -->

* The next integration to be rolled out in the future is with [[!DNL Adobe Workfront]](https://www.workfront.com/).
