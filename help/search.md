<!-- TBD: Search behavior. Full-text search. Ranking and rank boosts. Hidden assets.
Report poor UX that users can only save a filtered search and not a simple search.
.
Are other supported files fully indexed and support full-text search? Eg. audio/videos files can at best have metadata indexed.
Anything about ranking of assets displayed in search results?

What about temporarily hiding an asset (suspending search on it) from the search results? If an asset is undergoing review collaboration, should it be used by others? Should it be hidden in search?

When userA is searching and userB add an asset that matches search results, will the asset display in search as soon as userA refreshes the page? Assuming indexing is near real-time. May not be so for bulk uploads.
