The options available in the left sidebar are:

* **Assets**: List of all folders and assets in a tree view, that you have access to.
* **Recently Viewed**: List of assets that you previewed recently. These are not the assets that displayed while browsing but the ones that were previewed.

You can open or collapse the left sidebar to increase the available asset-viewing area.
