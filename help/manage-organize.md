## Asset versioning {#create-versions}

[!DNL Assets Essentials] allows you to save multiple versions of the same asset. Having versions lets you review historical assets and revert to a previous version if needed. Asset versions are created in the following scenarios:

* Upload a new asset with the same filename as an existing asset and in the same folder as the existing asset. [!DNL Assets Essentials] prompts to either overwrite the previous asset or save the new asset as a version. See [upload duplicate assets](/help/add-delete.md#resolve-upload-fails).

* After editing an image, click **[!UICONTROL Save as Version]** to save the new image. See [edit images](/help/edit-images.md).

* Open the versions of an existing asset. Click **[!UICONTROL New Version]** and upload a newer version of the asset in the repository. See [view versions of an asset](/help/understand-interface.md#view-versions).
