# Bulk import assets using Assets view  {#bulk-import-assets-view}

Bulk Import in AEM Assets view provides administrators with the ability to import large number of assets from a data source to AEM Assets. The administrators do not need to upload individual assets or folders to AEM Assets anymore.

You can import assets from the following data sources:

* Azure
* AWS
* Google Cloud
* Dropbox
