## Add or upload assets {#add-assets}

You can add assets by dragging folders from your desktop to the user interface. To upload, you can choose to upload multiple files or an entire folder. Once you have selected the files, you get a confirmation dialog to choose to remove one or more files. Click **[!UICONTROL Upload]** to upload the selected files or folders.

To add more files to a selection, click **[!UICONTROL Browse]** > **[!UICONTROL Browse]**. Add more files or folders from the same or from a different folder. Once all files are queued, click **[!UICONTROL Upload]**.
