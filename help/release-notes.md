# Release notes of [!DNL Assets Essentials] {#release-notes}

The current release of [!DNL Assets Essentials] is released on August 30, 2021. It provides integrations with [!DNL Adobe Workfront] that lets [!DNL Workfront] users manage their digital assets in the context of managing their work. For more information, see [integrations with other Adobe solutions](/help/integration.md).

To know more about the solution, see the [introduction to [!DNL Assets Essentials]](introduction.md). To start using the features, see [get started](/help/get-started.md).

## Known issues {#known-issues}

The list of known issues of [!DNL Assets Essentials] offering is revised and updated on an ongoing basis:

* To upload a folder or assets, when you drag the items into a folder with subfolders in the repository, the upload goes into one of the subfolders automatically. The workaround is to click [!DNL Upload assets] option and drag into the dialog. <!-- CQ-4327753 -->
* After uploading folder, new folders may sometimes display incorrectly in the left rail instead of displaying in the tree view. The workaround is to refresh the browser. <!-- CQ-4323534 -->

<!--
* Use assets that do not have whitespace in the file names. The replies to comments do not work for such assets.
-->

If you come across any issues or even enhancement requests, [provide feedback](#provide-feedback) to the team.
