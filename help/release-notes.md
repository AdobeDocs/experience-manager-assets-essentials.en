## Known issues {#known-issues}

Assets Essentials has the following known issues: 

* Download of multiple assets or folders does not work currently (workaround: download files one-by-one)
* Restoring assets from Trash (after having deleted them) might fail (workaround: click on the deleted assets, go to Renditions and click on the Original to download, then re-upload manually)
* Bulk operations on assets (copy, move, delete/restore)might fail batches larger than 50 assets (workaround: select up to 50 assets at once)
* Renditions do not appear to be updated on asset update (workaround: a hard refresh in the browser)
* Effects of certain other operations might not be shown in the UI immediately (workaround: a hard refresh in the browser)

Product team is working with the highest priority on fixing these as soon as possible and we will remove them from the list as they get fixed.

If you come across any other issues, [provide feedback](#provide-feedback) to the team.
