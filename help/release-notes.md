* Basic asset management operations like edit, download, metadata management, and so on.
* Integration with [!DNL Adobe Journey Optimizer].

## Known issues {#known-issues}

[!DNL Assets Essentials] has the following known issues for now.

* For now, you cannot download multiple assets or folders. Workaround is to download files or folders one at a time.
* Restoring a deleted asset from Trash may fail. Workaround is to click on the deleted asset, view its Renditions, and click on the Original asset to download. Re-upload this original asset manually.
* Bulk operations on assets (copy, move, delete or restore) may fail if done in batches of more than 50 assets. Workaround is to select up to 50 assets in one go.
* Renditions are updated when an asset is updated but the old renditions continue to display. Workaround is to refresh the browser.
* After an operation, the changes may not display in the user interface immediately. Workaround is to refresh the browser.

Adobe is working to fix these as soon as possible and will update this list as issues get fixed.
