Assets Essentials provides smart editing options powered by Adobe Photoshop Express. You can save the edited image as a new version. You can revert to original asset later.

How to view a list of versions and some info about creation date, etc. Is this same as timeline concept in Assets?
How to preview old version image?
How to pick a version and revert to it anywhere from the timeline.
