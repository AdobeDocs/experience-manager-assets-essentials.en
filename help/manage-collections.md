# Manage collections {#manage-collections}

A collection is a set of assets within Experience Manager Assets Essentials. Use collections to share assets between users.

Unlike folders, a collection can include assets from different locations. You can share collections with various users that are assigned different levels of privileges, including viewing, editing, and so on.

You can share multiple collections with a user. Each collection contains references to assets. The referential integrity of assets is maintained across collections.

## Create a collection {#create-collection}

To create a collection:

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Collections]** in the left rail and then click **[!UICONTROL Create Collection]**.

1. Specify a title and an optional description for the collection.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Public Collection]** if you need to share the collection with all users. You can select **[!UICONTROL Private Collection]** and then manage permissions to provide access to limited set of users.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save the collection.

## Add assets to a collection {#add-assets-to-collection}

## Manage access to a collection {#manage-collection-access}

The permission management for collections function in the same manner as folders in [!DNL Assets Essentials]. Administrators can manage the access levels for collections available in the repository. As an administrator, you can create user groups and assign permissions to those groups to manage access levels. You can also delegate the permission management privileges to user groups at the collection-level.
