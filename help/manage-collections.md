# Manage collections {#manage-collections}

A collection is a set of assets within Experience Manager Assets Essentials. Use collections to share assets between users.

Unlike folders, a collection can include assets from different locations. You can share collections with various users that are assigned different levels of privileges, including viewing, editing, and so on.

You can share multiple collections with a user. Each collection contains references to assets. The referential integrity of assets is maintained across collections.
