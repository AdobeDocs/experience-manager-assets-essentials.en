# Manage collections {#manage-collections}

A collection is a set of assets within Experience Manager Assets Essentials. Use collections to share assets between users.

Unlike folders, a collection can include assets from different locations. 

<!--
You can share collections with various users that are assigned different levels of privileges, including viewing, editing, and so on.
-->

You can share multiple collections with a user. Each collection contains references to assets. The referential integrity of assets is maintained across collections.

You can perform the following tasks to manage and use collections:

* [Create a collection](#create-collection)

* [Add assets to a collection](#add-assets-to-collection)

* [Remove assets to a collection](#remove-assets-from-collection)

* [View and edit collection metadata](#view-edit-collection-metadata)

* [Download collection elements](#download-collection-elements)

* [Delete a collection](#delete-collection)

## Manage access to a collection {#manage-collection-access}

The permission management for collections function in the same manner as folders in [!DNL Assets Essentials]. Administrators can manage the access levels for collections available in the repository. As an administrator, you can create user groups and assign permissions to those groups to manage access levels. You can also delegate the permission management privileges to user groups at the collection-level.

For more information, see [Manage permissions for folders and collections](manage-permissions.md).

## Search a collection {#search-collections}

Click **[!UICONTROL Collections]** in the left rail and use the Search box to specify a text as the criteria to search for a collection. [!DNL Assets Essentials] uses the specified text to search collection names, metadata including tags defined for a collection and returns appropriate results.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Assets Essentials performs search in collections available at the root level. It does not perform search in assets and folders available in collections.

## Share links for collections {#share-collection-links}

[!DNL Assets Essentials] enables you to generate a link and share collections and assets within collections with external stakeholders, who do not have access to the [!DNL Assets Essentials] application. You can define an expiration date for the link and then share it with others using your preferred communication method like email or messaging services. Recipients of the link can preview assets and download them.
