## Saved searches {#saved-search}

<!-- TBD: Search behavior. Full-text search. Ranking and rank boosts. Hidden assets.

Talk about factors that help assets surface up in search results. Keyword must appear in content or in smart tags.
Are PDFs fully indexed and support full-text search?
Is audio from MP4 files transcribed and indexed?
Anything about confidence and ranking of assets displayed in search results?
What about temporarily hiding an asset (suspending search on it) from the search results? If an asset is undergoing review collaboration, should it be used by others? Shouldn't it be hidden in search?
If someone adds another asset, will it display in search as soon as the first user refreshes the page.
